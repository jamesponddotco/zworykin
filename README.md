# Hamilton

Hamilton is a clean WordPress portfolio theme for creatives designed by
[Anders Nor√©n](https://andersnoren.se/).

This repository holds a fork of the theme modified to follow the
[WordPress coding
standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/).
No design changes have been made to the theme, but animations and
related posts have been removed to improve performance.
